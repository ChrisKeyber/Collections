What is the program doing
--------------------------
This program allows you to make a collections of books and it can be modified after that,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Reminders:

When you see any error except not valid options,(e.g. index fail, missing, file missing etc), Your collection record is not in the same format


You have to delete both file manually.

bugs
----
A.!!!! Major bugs!!!!!
You can only use this program in the same folder to the file
if the txt and inx file is not in the same folder to the program, it will rather generate a new file or collapse


B.
When you put a num to index manually, the program cannot find out, the record is broken at the time.
