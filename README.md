# Collections
A Collections of books, actually just a simple practice program for different basics


Im still working on this program currently (actually it is a practice program from my learning e.g string, array, validate, functions, struct etc)
It is just a practice program for me like a milestone


What is the app doing:
This program allows you to make a collections of books and it can be modified after that,

Reminders:


When you see any error except not valid options,(e.g. index fail, missing, file missing etc), Your collection record is not in the same format


You have to delete both file manually.




!!!! PLEASE READ THE A BUGS!!!!

bugs

A.!!!! Major bugs!!!!!
You can only use this program in the same folder to the file
if the txt and inx file is not in the same folder to the program, it will rather generate a new file or collapse

B.



When you put a num to index manually, the program cannot find out, the record is broken at the time.

3/3/2022 : Pausing the system for the program to show messages (Which is apparentely a bad practice to do ;) )

4/3/2022 : Solve major bug, option 3 can now delete inx file 
Currently, you won't able to delete the inx file by choosing option 3, unknown reasons, you have to delete 
index file manually
(Or what I prefer is "Preventing users from accidentialy scratch the index and cause fail to program" XD
inx file is just an idea for me to create a file extension, I want to do it since then O.O)
