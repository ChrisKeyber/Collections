# Collections
A Collections of books, actually just a simple practice program for different basics


Im still working on this program currently (actually it is a practice program from my learning e.g string, array, validate, functions, struct etc)
It is just a practice program for me like a milestone


bugs

A.
You can only use this program in the same folder to the file
if the txt and inx file is not in the same folder to the program, it will rather generate a new file or collapse

B.
Currently, you won't able to delete the inx file by choosing option 3, unknown reasons, you have to delete 
index file manually


(Or what I prefer is "Preventing users from accidentialy scratch the index and cause fail to program" XD
inx file is just an idea for me to create a file extension, I want to do it since then O.O)


C.
If one of txt or inx is deleted outside the program, please delete the other one also, else the new file

using the same name will have error on inx


D.
I believe those are the bugs, but if there are any serious bug, please tell me p0.0q

(Basically excpet for A, B, if you be a nice dude/girl, the program won't have error :) )
